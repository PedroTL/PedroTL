### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---
I'm JoÃ£o Pedro T. T. Lucas, an extension fellow at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas Observatory](https://observatorio.puc-campinas.edu.br/) in Brazil.

### Intrests
---
I'm deeply passionate about academic research, particularly in the field of regional economy. My focus revolves around using spatial and data analysis to visualize and comprehend crucial indicators that significantly impact society.

- Regional Economy
- Spatial Data Science
- Crime Economy
- Urban Vulnerability

### Experience
---
Since 2022, I've been actively engaged in research as an extension fellow. Initially, I contributed to the Productive Structure and Socioeconomic Development project, conducting comprehensive studies on the foreign trade of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC). Additionally, I collaborated on the Socio-Territorial Diagnosis project in partnership with the FEAC Foundation. This involved analyzing microdata from the federal program, Unified Registry (Cadastro Ãšnico), contributing to the development of a unique [geocoding](https://feac.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Geocodificacao_FEAC.pdf?portfolioCats=3105#new_tab) methodology for registered families. In both projects, my research delved into regional economic indicators, aiming to offer pivotal support to key sectors of the economy.
